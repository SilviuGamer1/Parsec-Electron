Parsec Web combined with Electron it's not much but i'll try to improve it later.
Feel free to add to this repo

## Instalation

Download NPM

Donwload Electron with: npm i -D electron@latest

Now run in CLI: "npm init", set the main entry point as "index.js"

After you did that open package.json and under "scripts" add "start: "electron ." "

If all goes well run "npm start" and it should start "Parsec Electron Example"

Optionally you can install Electron Packager to make this an executable
